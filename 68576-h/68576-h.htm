<p>“There are some ghosts,” said poor Jack,
“that will not easily bear raising....”</p>

<p>Thus am I confounded by words of my own
choosing, for in truth I have raised one; and
not for me, as for Dame Sylvia, does Chivalry
blow upon a silver horn to drown the squeakings
of that folly. Which is merely another
way of saying that those younglings we two
know and love, and who fretted me into the
writing of a play for their theatricals, have rejected
the outcome after a tentative rehearsal,
with certain remarks for my pondering.</p>

<p>Well might that fat whoresome man have
been left to the undignified fate his creator had
appointed for him!—or at least in the staider
trappings wherewith I did gird his behemothian
bulk in my story, <i>The Love Letters
of Falstaff</i>. Decked for the stage and with
bella donna in its eyes, my sketch, they tell me,
is a ghastly remains to which the footlights
would add but the effect of funeral candles. In
fine, that which lacks both plot and action, and
offers, in lieu of lusty characters, four gray
ghosts, is not a play but an edifying exposé of
the pitfalls and snares into which a romancist
might be expected to stumble when he dons the
habit of a playwright. These and many other
plaints which I shall strive to live down in the
years before me, conveyed a discomforting
unanimity of opinion on the part of my hopeful
players.</p>

<p>With such humility as becomes one of our
soberer estate in the presence of these, our
juniors and betters, I pointed out that it was
not my fault, assuredly, that Falstaff was no
longer the merry taker of purses whose roaring
oaths had filled all Gadshill. Nor that Will
had never displayed any very hearty admiration
for humanity nor found many more commendable
traits in general exercise among its
individuals than did the authors of the Bible:
a spirit which, however distasteful to my palate,
I was obliged in this instance to emulate!
Yet I dared think (and my defense grew
noticeably weaker under their incredulous
stare) that old, gross and decayed as he had
grown, the demiurge still clings to the old
reprobate; yea, and the aura of divinity to
Helen, whose beauty is drifting dust, so that
Falstaff sees before him not Sylvia Vernon but
Sylvia Darke.</p>

<p>Poor Falstaff. “Were’t not for laughing I
should pity him!”</p>

<p>But they had since ceased to listen. Vanished
were they like the merry company whose mere
names, thought Falstaff, were like a breath of
country air. My script lay before me, eloquent
in naught but their disillusion. Alone, I thought
the fire winked knowingly at me, much like the
one I had fanned from the embers of the past,
as if it said: How old must a man become ’ere
he shall be wise enough to content these sure
young critics, so awfully and so inevitably
right?</p>

<p>I should have dropped the record of my folly
into the flames and so played out the last scene
in my puppet’s stead, had I not remembered in
time my promise to you. Well!—you had expected
to receive it worn from the caresses of
eager thumbs, scented perhaps with the bouquet
of reverent applause. It comes to you fresh
and unmarred by any defacing ardor; only its
theme is sere, only its author’s vanity thumb-marked!</p>

<p>And remember: ’tis not a play you give to
the world but rather a spirit croaking to itself
in a house where nobody has lived for a long
time.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>(<i>The curtain rises to show the Angel room
of the Boar’s Head Tavern in Eastcheap. ’Tis
the private parlor of the mistress of the inn</i>,
<span class="smcap">Dame Quickly</span>.</p>

<p><i>At the back is a high fireplace with heavy
leaded diamond paned windows on either side.
At the left is the doorway leading to the tap
room, on the right a huge clothes press. When
our play opens</i> <span class="smcap">Dame Quickly</span> <i>is demurely
stirring the fire while</i> <span class="smcap">Bardolph</span> <i>is sorting garments
which he takes from the press. We hear
a quivery voice singing</i>: “Then Came Bold Sir
Caradoc” ... <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Sir John Falstaff</span> <i>fumbles
at the door and enters. It is a</i> <span class="smcap">Falstaff</span> <i>much
broken since his loss of the King’s favor and
now equally decayed in wit, health and reputation.
His paunch alone remains prosperous
and monstrous and contrasts greatly with the
shrunken remainder of the man. He is particularly
shaky this morning after a night’s
hard drinking. Nevertheless he enters with
what cheerfulness he can muster.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span></p>

<p class="center">FALSTAFF</p>

<p>(<i>sings</i>) Then came the Bold Sir Caradoc—Ah,
Mistress what news?—and eke Sir
Pellinore—Did I rage last night, Bardolph?
Was I a Bedlamite?</p>

<p class="center">BARDOLPH</p>

<p>As mine own bruises can testify. Had each
one of them a tongue they would raise a clamor
beside which Babel were an heir weeping for
his rich uncle’s death; their testimony would
qualify you for any mad-house in England.
And if their evidence go against the doctor’s
stomach, the watchman at the corner hath
three teeth—or rather, hath them no longer,
since you knocked them out last night, that will
willingly aid him to digest it.</p>

<p class="center">FALSTAFF</p>

<p>(<i>as he stiffly lowers his great body into the
great chair that awaits him beside the fire and
stretches his hands to catch the heat of the
flames.</i>) Three say you? I would have my
valor in all men’s mouths, but not in this fashion,
for it is too biting a jest. Three, say you?
Well, I am glad it was no worse; I have a tender
conscience and that mad fellow of the
North, Hotspur, sits heavily upon it, so that
thus this Percy, being slain by my valor, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
<i>per se</i> avenged, a plague upon him! Three,
say you? I would to God my name were not so
terrible to the enemy as it is; I would I had
’bated my natural inclination somewhat and
slain less tall fellows by three score. I doubt
Agamemnon slept not well o’ nights. Three,
say you? Give the fellow a crown apiece for
his mouldy teeth, if thou hast them; if thou
hast them not, bid him eschew this vice of
drunkenness whereby his misfortune hath befallen
him, and thus win him heavenly crowns.</p>

<p class="center">BARDOLPH</p>

<p>Indeed Sir, I doubt....</p>

<p class="center">FALSTAFF</p>

<p>(<i>testily</i>) Doubt not, Sirrah! (<i>He continues
more calmly in a virtuous manner</i>) Was not
the apostle reproved for that same sin? Thou
art a Didymus, Bardolph,—an incredulous
paynim, a most unspeculative rogue. Have I
carracks trading in the Indies? Have I robbed
the exchequer of late? Have I the Golden
Fleece for a cloak? Nay, it is a paltry gimlet,
and that augurs badly. Why does this knavish
watchman take me for a raven to feed him in
the wilderness? Tell him that there are no
such ravens hereabouts; else I had ravenously
limed the house-tops and sets springes in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
gutters. Inform him that my purse is no better
lined than his own broken skull; it is void
as a beggar’s protestations, or a butcher’s stall
in Lent; light as a famished gnat, or the sighing
of a new-made widower; more empty than
a last year’s bird’s nest, than a madman’s eye,
or, in fine, than the friendship of a king.</p>

<p class="center">MISTRESS QUICKLY</p>

<p>But you have wealthy friends, Sir John. (<i>She
nods her head vigorously</i>) Yes I warrant you
Sir John. Sir John, you have a many wealthy
friends; you cannot deny that, Sir John.</p>

<p class="center">FALSTAFF</p>

<p>(<i>He cowers closer to the fire as though he were
a little cold</i>) I have no friends since Hal is
King. I had I grant you, a few score of acquaintances
whom I taught to play at dice;
paltry young blades of the City, very unfledged
juvenals! Setting my knighthood and my valor
aside, if I did swear friendship with these,
I did swear to a lie. But this is a censorious
and muddy-minded world, so that, look you,
even these sprouting aldermen, these foul, bacon-fed
rogues, have fled my friendship of
late, and my reputation hath grown somewhat
more murky than Erebus. No matter! I walk
alone as one that hath the pestilence. No matter!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
But I grow old, I am not in the vanward
of my youth, Mistress.</p>

<p>(<i>He reaches for the cup of sack that</i> <span class="smcap">Bardolph</span>
<i>has poured out and holds on a tray at his elbow</i>.)</p>

<p class="center">MISTRESS QUICKLY</p>

<p>Indeed, I do not know what your worship will
do.</p>

<p class="center">FALSTAFF</p>

<p>(<i>Drinks the sack down and grins in a somewhat
ghostly fashion</i>) Faith! unless the
Providence that watches over the fall of a
sparrow hath an eye to the career of Sir John
Falstaff, Knight, and so comes to my aid shortly,
I must need convert my last doublet into a
mask and turn highwayman in my shirt. I can
take purses yet, ye Uzzite comforters, as gaily
as I did at Gadshill, where that scurvy Poins,
and he that is now King, and some twoscore
other knaves did afterward assault me in the
dark; yet I peppered some of them I warrant
you.</p>

<p class="center">BARDOLPH</p>

<p>You must be rid of me then, Master. I for
one have no need of a hempen collar.</p>

<p class="center">FALSTAFF</p>

<p>(<i>stretching himself in the chair</i>) I, too, would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
be loth to break the gallow’s back. For fear
of halters, we must alter our way of living;
we must live close, Bardolph, till the wars make
us Croesuses or food for crows. And if Hal
but hold to his bias, there will be wars: I will
eat a piece of my sword, if he hath not need
of it shortly. Ah, go thy ways, tall Jack; there
live not three good men in England and one
of them is fat, and grows old. We must live
close, Bardolph, we must forswear drinking
and wenching! But there is lime in this sack,
you rogue, give me another cup.</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Bardolph</span> <i>draws and brings him another cup
of sack which he empties at one long draught</i>.)</p>

<p class="center">FALSTAFF</p>

<p>I pray you hostess, remember that Doll Tearsheet
sups with me tonight; have a capon of
the best and be not sparing of your wine. I
will repay you, upon honor, when we young
fellows return from France, all laden with
rings and brooches and such trumperies like
your Norfolkshire pedlars at Christmas-tide.
We will sack a town for you, and bring you
back the Lord Mayor’s beard to stuff you a
cushion; the Dauphin shall be your tapster yet:
we will walk on lilies, I warrant you to the tune
of “hey then, up go we.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span></p>

<p class="center">MISTRESS QUICKLY</p>

<p>Indeed, Sir, your worship is as welcome to my
pantry as the mice—a pox on them—think
themselves; you are heartily welcome. Ah,
well, old Puss is dead; I had her of Goodman
Quickly these ten years since;—but I had
thought that you looked for the lady who was
here but now;—she was a roaring lion among
the mice.</p>

<p class="center">FALSTAFF</p>

<p>(<i>with great animation</i>) What Lady? Was it
Flint the Mercer’s wife, think you? Ah, she
hath a liberal disposition, and will, without the
aid of Prince Houssain’s carpet or the horse of
Cambuscan, transfer the golden shining pieces
from her husband’s coffers to mine.</p>

<p class="center">MISTRESS QUICKLY</p>

<p>(<i>after due consideration</i>) No mercer’s wife,
I think. She came with two patched footmen
and smelled of gentility;—Master Dumbleton’s
father was a mercer; but he had red hair;—she
is old;—and I could never abide red hair.</p>

<p class="center">FALSTAFF</p>

<p>No matter! I can love this lady, be she a very
Witch of Endor. Observe what a thing it is
to be a proper man, Bardolph! She hath
marked me;—in public, perhaps; on the street,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
it may be;—and then, I warrant you, made
such eyes! and sighed such sighs! and lain
awake o’ nights, thinking of a pleasing portly
gentleman, whom, were I not modesty’s self,
I might name;—and I, all this while, not knowing!
Fetch me my book of riddles and my sonnets,
that I may speak smoothly. Why was
my beard not combed this morning? No matter,
it will serve. Have I no better cloak than
this?</p>

<p class="center">MISTRESS QUICKLY</p>

<p><i>(who has been looking out of the window</i>)
Come, but your worship must begin with unwashed
hands, for old Madame Wishfor’t and
her two country louts are even now at the door.</p>

<p class="center">FALSTAFF</p>

<p>Avaunt, minions. Avaunt! Conduct the lady
hither, hostess; Bardolph another cup of sack.
We will ruffle it, lad, and go to France all gold
like Midas! Are mine eyes too red? I must
look sad, you know, and sigh very pitifully.
Ah, we will ruffle it! Another cup of sack,
Bardolph;—I am a rogue if I have drunk to-day.
And avaunt! vanish! for the lady comes!
(<i>He throws himself into what he feels is a
gallant attitude, but that is one that suggests
to the audience a man suddenly palsied trying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
to imitate a turkey cock and struts to the door.
The lady that enters is on the staider side
of sixty, but the years have touched her with
unwonted kindliness and her form is still unbent,
her countenance, although bloodless and
deep furrowed still bears the traces of great
beauty and she is unquestionably a person of
breeding.</i> <span class="smcap">Sir John</span> <i>advances to her with his
peculiar strut; indubitably he feels himself a
miracle of elegance</i>.)</p>

<p class="center">FALSTAFF</p>

<p>See, from the glowing East, Aurora Comes!
Madam permit me to welcome you to my poor
apartments; they are not worthy....</p>

<p class="center">LADY SYLVIA</p>

<p>I would see Sir John Falstaff, sir.</p>

<p class="center">FALSTAFF</p>

<p>Indeed, Madam, if those bright eyes—whose
glances have already cut my poor heart into
as many pieces as the man in the front of the
almanac—will but desist for a moment from
such butcher’s work and do their proper duty,
you will have little trouble in finding the bluff
soldier you seek.</p>

<p class="center">LADY SYLVIA</p>

<p>Are you Sir John? The son of old Sir Edward
Falstaff of Norfolk?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span></p>

<p class="center">FALSTAFF</p>

<p>His wife hath frequently assured me so, and
to confirm her evidence I have about me a certain
villainous thirst that did plague Sir Edward
sorely in his lifetime and came to me
with his other chattels. The property I have
expended long since; but no Jew will advance
me a maravedi on the Falstaff thirst. It is a
priceless commodity, not to be bought or sold;
you might as soon quench it.</p>

<p class="center">LADY SYLVIA</p>

<p>I would not have known you, but, I have not
seen you these forty years.</p>

<p class="center">FALSTAFF</p>

<p>Faith, Madam, the great pilferer Time hath
taken away a little from my hair, and somewhat
added—saving your presence—to my
belly; and my face hath not been improved by
being the grindstone for some hundred swords.
But I do not know you.</p>

<p class="center">LADY SYLVIA</p>

<p>I am Sylvia Vernon. And once years ago I
was Sylvia Darke.</p>

<p class="center">FALSTAFF</p>

<p>I remember. (<i>His voice changes, he also loses
his strut as he hands</i> <span class="smcap">Lady Sylvia</span> <i>to the great
chair</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span></p>

<p class="center">LADY SYLVIA</p>

<p>(<i>after a long pause</i>) A long time ago. Time
hath dealt harshly with us both, John;—the
name hath a sweet savor. I am an old woman
now. And you?</p>

<p class="center">FALSTAFF</p>

<p>I would not have known you. (<i>Resentfully</i>)
What do you here?</p>

<p class="center">LADY SYLVIA</p>

<p>My son goes to the wars and I am come to
bid him farewell; yet I should not tarry in London
for my lord is feeble and hath constant
need of me. But I, an old woman, am yet vain
enough to steal these few moments from him
who needs me, to see for the last time, mayhap,
him who once was my very dear friend.</p>

<p class="center">FALSTAFF</p>

<p>I was never your friend, Sylvia.</p>

<p class="center">LADY SYLVIA</p>

<p>(<i>with a wistful smile</i>) Ah the old wrangle.
My dear and very honored lover, then; and I
am come to see him here.</p>

<p class="center">FALSTAFF</p>

<p>Ay.... ’Tis a quiet orderly place, where
I bestow my patronage; the woman of the
house had a husband once in my company.
God rest his soul! he bore a good pike. He retired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
in his old age and ’stablished this tavern
where he passed his declining years, till death
called him gently away from this naughty
world. God rest his soul, say I. (<i>aside</i>) God
wot, I cannot tell her that the rogue was
knocked over the head with a joint-stool while
rifling the pockets of a drunken roisterer!</p>

<p class="center">LADY SYLVIA</p>

<p>And you for old memories’ sake yet aid his
widow? That is like you, John. (<i>There is a
long silence in which the crackling of the fire
can be plainly heard.</i>) And are you sorry that
I come again, in a worse body, John, strange
and time ruined?</p>

<p class="center">FALSTAFF</p>

<p>Sorry?... No, faith! but there are some
ghosts that will not easily bear raising and you
have raised one.</p>

<p class="center">LADY SYLVIA</p>

<p>We have summoned up no very fearful spectre,
I think. At most no worse than a pallid gentle
spirit that speaks—to me at least—of a boy
and a girl who loved each other and were very
happy a great while ago.</p>

<p class="center">FALSTAFF</p>

<p>And you come hither to seek that boy? The
boy that went mad and rhymed of you in those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
far off dusty years? He is quite dead, my lady,
he was drowned, mayhap in a cup of wine; or
he was slain, perchance, by some few light women.
I know not how he died. But he is quite
dead, my lady, and I had not been haunted by
his ghost until to-day. (<i>He breaks into a fit
of unromantic coughing</i>)</p>

<p class="center">LADY SYLVIA</p>

<p>He was a dear boy. A boy who loved a young
maid very truly; a boy that found the maid’s
father too strong and shrewd for desperate
young lovers—eh, how long ago it seems and
what a flood of tears the poor maid shed at being
parted from that dear boy.</p>

<p class="center">FALSTAFF</p>

<p>Faith! the rogue had his good points.</p>

<p class="center">LADY SYLVIA</p>

<p>Ah, John, you have not forgotten, I know and
you will believe me that I am heartily sorry
for the pain I brought into your life.</p>

<p class="center">FALSTAFF</p>

<p>My wounds heal easily—</p>

<p class="center">LADY SYLVIA</p>

<p>For though my dear dead father was too wise
for us, and knew it was for the best that I
should not accept your love, believe me John,
I always knew the value of it and have held it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
an honor that any woman must prize.</p>

<p class="center">FALSTAFF</p>

<p>Dear Lady, the world is not altogether of your
opinion.</p>

<p class="center">LADY SYLVIA</p>

<p>I know not of the world, for we live away from
it. But we have heard of you ever and anon;
I have your life writ letter perfect these forty
years or more.</p>

<p class="center">FALSTAFF</p>

<p>You have heard of me?</p>

<p class="center">LADY SYLVIA</p>

<p>As a gallant and brave soldier. Of how you
fought at sea with Mowbray that was afterward
Duke of Norfolk; of your knighthood
by King Richard; of how you slew the Percy
at Shrewsbury; and captured Coleville o’ late
in Yorkshire; and how the prince, that is now
King, did love you above all other men; and in
fine, of many splendid doings in the great
world.</p>

<p class="center">FALSTAFF</p>

<p>I have fought somewhat. But we are not
Bevis of Southampton; we have slain no
giants. Have you heard naught else?</p>

<p class="center">LADY SYLVIA</p>

<p>Little else of note. But we are very proud of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
you at home in Norfolk. And such tales as I
have heard I have woven together in one story;
and I have told it many times to my children
as we sat on the old Chapel steps at evening
and the shadows lengthened across the lawn,
and I bid them emulate this, the most perfect
knight and gallant gentleman I have ever
known. And they love you, I think, though
but by repute.</p>

<p>(<i>There is another long silence, finally</i>—)</p>

<p class="center">FALSTAFF</p>

<p>Do you still live at Winstead?</p>

<p class="center">LADY SYLVIA</p>

<p>Yes, in the old house. It is little changed, but
there are many changes about.</p>

<p class="center">FALSTAFF</p>

<p>Is Moll yet with you that did once carry our
letters?</p>

<p class="center">LADY SYLVIA</p>

<p>Married to Hodge, the tanner, and dead long
since.</p>

<p class="center">FALSTAFF</p>

<p>And all our merry company? Marian? and
Tom and little Osric? And Phyllis? and Adelais?
Zounds, it is like a breath of country air
to speak their names once more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span></p>

<p class="center">LADY SYLVIA</p>

<p>(<i>She speaks in a hushed voice</i>) All dead save
Adelais and even to me poor Adelais seems old
and strange. Walter was slain in the French
wars and she hath never married.</p>

<p class="center">FALSTAFF</p>

<p>All dead.... This same death hath a
wide maw. It is not long before you and I, my
lady, will be at supper with the worms. But
you at least have had a happy life?</p>

<p class="center">LADY SYLVIA</p>

<p>I have been content enough, but all that seems
run by; for, John, I think that at our age we
are not any longer very happy, or very miserable.</p>

<p class="center">FALSTAFF</p>

<p>Faith! we are both old; and I had not known
it, my lady until to-day.</p>

<p>(<i>Again silence. Finally</i> <span class="smcap">Lady Sylvia</span> <i>rises
with a start</i>.)</p>

<p class="center">LADY SYLVIA</p>

<p>I would I had not come.</p>

<p class="center">FALSTAFF</p>

<p>Nay, this is but a feeble grieving you have
awakened. For, madam, you whom I loved
once—you are in the right. Our blood runs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
thinner than of yore; and we may no longer,
I think, either rejoice or sorrow very deeply.</p>

<p class="center">LADY SYLVIA</p>

<p>It is true.... I must go ... and
indeed I would to God, that I had not come.
(<span class="smcap">Falstaff</span> <i>bows his head and remains silent.
Presently she goes on</i>) Yet, there is something
here which I must keep no longer; for
here are all the letters you ever writ me. (<i>She
hands him a little packet. He turns them awkwardly
in his hands once or twice; stares at
them and then at her.</i>)</p>

<p class="center">FALSTAFF</p>

<p>You have kept them—always?</p>

<p class="center">LADY SYLVIA</p>

<p>Yes, but I must not be guilty of continuing such
follies. It is a villainous example to my grandchildren....
Farewell.</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Falstaff</span> <i>draws close to her and takes both
her hands in his. He looks her in the eyes and
draws himself very erect.</i>)</p>

<p class="center">FALSTAFF</p>

<p>How I loved you!</p>

<p class="center">LADY SYLVIA</p>

<p>I know and I thank you for your gift, my lover,
O brave, true lover, whose love I was not ever
ashamed to own! Farewell, my dear, yet a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
while, and I go to seek the boy and girl we
know of.</p>

<p class="center">FALSTAFF</p>

<p>I shall not be long, madam. Speak a kind
word for me in Heaven; for I have sore need
of it.</p>

<p class="center">LADY SYLVIA</p>

<p>(<i>By this time she has reached the door</i>) You
are not sorry that I came?</p>

<p class="center">FALSTAFF</p>

<p>There are many wrinkles now in your dear
face, my lady, the great eyes are a little dimmed,
and the sweet laughter is a little cracked;
but I am not sorry to have seen you thus. For
I have loved no woman truly save you alone;
and I am not sorry. Farewell. (<i>He bends over
and reverently kisses her fingers. Then she
leaves as quietly as a cloud passes.</i>)</p>

<p class="center">FALSTAFF</p>

<p>(<i>he goes back to the chair by the fire and sits
at ease</i>) Lord, Lord, how subject we old men
are to the vice of lying.... Yet it was
not all a lie;—but what a coil over a youthful
greensickness ’twixt a lad and a wench more
than forty years syne.... I might have
had money of her for the asking, yet I am glad
I did not; which is a parlous sign and smacks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
of dotage.... Were it not a quaint conceit,
a merry tickle-brain of Fate that this
mountain of malmsey were once a delicate
stripling with apple cheeks and a clean breath,
smelling of civit and as mad for love, I warrant
you as any Amadis of them all? For, if
a man were to speak truly, I did love her. I
had special marks of the pestilence. Not all
the flagons and apples in the universe might
have comforted me; I was wont to sigh like
a leaky bellows; to weep like a wench that is
lost of her granddam; to lard my speech with
the fagends of ballads like a man milliner; and
did indeed indite sonnets, cazonets and what
not of mine own elaboration.... And
Moll did carry them, plump, brown-eyed Moll
that hath married Hodge, the tanner and
reared her tannikins and died long since.</p>

<p>Lord, Lord, what did I not write (<i>He draws
a paper from the packet and leaning over deciphers
the faded writing by the fire light.</i>)</p>

<p>Is it not the very puling speech of your true

<p>And she hath commended me to her children
as a very gallant gentleman and a true knight.
Jove that sees all hath a goodly commodity of

“<i>Among the folk that bear thee company</i>”

rogue.</p>

have lived cleanly and forsworn sack, he might
have been a gallant gentleman and begotten
grandchildren and had a quiet nook at the ingleside
to rest his old bones; but he is dead
long since. He might have writ himself <i>armigero</i>

him save unpaid tavern bills; he might
have heard cases, harried poachers and quoted
old saws; and slept in his own family chapel

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
